I was responsible for creating the core code of a WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) RESTful project, laying the foundation for its architecture and ensuring it met both performance and scalability requirements. This involved designing and implementing key functionalities that enabled efficient communication between systems using RESTful services.


8. Unit Testing and Service Validation: I wrote unit tests for core components to ensure code quality and reliability. This included mocking service dependencies and validating the behavior of the service methods under different scenarios, ensuring that the core code worked as expected.



Throughout the project, I focused on delivering a robust and scalable WCF RESTful service that met the functional and non-functional requirements, while also adhering to best practices for security, performance, and maintainability.
