I achieved a minimum code coverage of 80% by setting clear coverage goals and utilizing testing frameworks like [specific tools used, e.g., JUnit, Jest]. I focused on writing comprehensive unit tests and implemented integration and end-to-end tests to cover critical functionality. By adopting Test-Driven Development (TDD), I ensured tests were written alongside new code. Regularly generating coverage reports helped identify areas needing improvement, and I used continuous integration to run tests automatically with each commit. This structured approach and emphasis on quality led to consistently maintaining over 80% code coverage.
