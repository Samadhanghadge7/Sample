I played a key role in managing and delivering the project, overseeing both its execution and the development of critical functionalities. My responsibilities included gathering and analyzing requirements, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and ensuring that the project aligned with business objectives.

Key Functionalities Developed:

1. Core System Integration: I worked on integrating various systems to ensure seamless data flow and interoperability. This involved developing APIs and data pipelines to connect existing platforms with new applications.
Testing and Quality Assurance: I established a rigorous testing process, which included unit testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT). This ensured that the functionalities met quality standards before deployment.



Throughout the project, I focused on delivering high-quality functionalities that addressed business needs, improved operational efficiency, and enhanced user experience.
